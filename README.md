# Universal-polynomials-for-nodal-curves-on-surfaces
This project uses the Caporaso-Harris and Vakil's invariants  to compute universal polynomials of nodal curves on surfaces satisfying given tangency conditions.

### Prerequisites
Mathematica (recent versions). 

### Installing

No installation is needed.

### How to use

If you just want to look at the computed results, just open the corresponding file and the results are ready.

If you want to run the computation yourself:
1. open the corresponding file  
2. follow the instruction on the top of the file to evaluate data files
3. evalute the file

### Tests

The computed result is under /results directory. Run the computation by yourself and see if the results match.
